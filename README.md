# odin-sign-up-form

The project is mostly complete. When I next work on it, my first goal is to make sure that the page looks good in different resolutions, which mostly means fixing the way the 2 columns for either side of the page resize, and fixing how the left hand side image changes size too, so that it matches the width of the container or something.

After this I will have to check the project against the actual TOP requirements on the project page.
