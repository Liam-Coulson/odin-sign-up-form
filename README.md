# odin-sign-up-form

The project is complete now. I have stuck mostly to the template given without changing the logo, background image etc due to lack of creativity and wanting to learn how to implement forms properly.

I have added some validation using JavaScript to the password and confirm password fields. On every input change I check if each field matches and if they do, they are marked as valid (by setting their custom validity message to "" (empty)). The rest of the validation is done with the HTML5 form validation.

The "Create Account" button animations and styling was taken from w3schools from this link:
